2014-10-15  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [e0c1fea] :

	db_unixodbc: fix query result handling and improve performance
	Until now, query rows were incrementally stored in a list with
	separately allocated length and string buffers, along with a great deal
	of useless pointer dereferencing, effectively wasting CPU cycles and pkg
	mem usage.

	This patch eliminates the linked list logic with a global buffer of
	pointers (doubling in size when required) meant to hold each result column.
	Each column is transparently freed by the DB backend. This completes
	commit d63ee19a8.
	(cherry picked from commit 683dfaa63df0af317f7485042539bdacf8646eab)

2014-10-09  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [c7066fe] :

	Fix validation of the send_sock in t_uac().
	If a send_sock is already provided, no need to do socket discovery again. We need just the protocol (from mk_proxy) in order to validate (or not) the already given send_sock. Do socket discovery only if there no send_sock given or the protocol does not match.

	Fixes:
	- do not use the same proxy_l for multiple functions in script (remove the add_proxy() and find_proxy() )
	- avoid using the same proxy_l structure for all the calls of same function (when proxy_l is a function parameter)

	Fixes #224
	Many thanks for Chris Maciejewski ( @l7s ) for support on troublehsooting this.

		* shm statistics are based on 32/64-bit atomic counters
			- the former logic is still available with HP_MALLOC_FAST_STATS

		* pkg statistics are implemented similarly to the other allocators

		* the MI workers iterate and aggregate all memory information
		* the built-in maximum sampling rate is 200ms
			- repeating a fetch in < 200ms will return the same results
		* this patch also corrects a rare deadlock in hp_realloc
			- hp_realloc "growth" may deadlock with hp_malloc "shrink"
			- the best solution is to drop the "growth" realloc operation
			- this also merges well with the allocator fragmentation requirements

	* [67cfefe] :

	Address concerns: clearly note that there was an error.


2014-03-19  Walter Doekes  <walter+github at wjd dot nu>
	* [9271a45] :

	Replace odd -j in module-submake with ability for proper parallelism.
	Recently `-j` was added to the list of flags passed to the modules
	$(MAKE) command. That's bad practise for two reasons: (1) the caller
	should decide on how much -j is required, not the programmer, and (2)
	just -j without any numeric argument is "use all resources you can
	get", which can be too much.

	We order the Makefile around so the supermake (the user invocation)
	can dispatch individual submakes in a parallel fashion. This is done
	by (a) making the module directories phony targets and (b) replacing
	the sequential for-loop over the modules with a simple dependency.

2014-03-10  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [f001f09] :

	Added support for multiple timer processes in TM. The timer process may easyly become a bottleneck in TM because: 	 (a) single lock on the timer lists, 	 (b) single process to purge/free all transactions, 	 (c) single process running all failure routes (with all script complexity of failure routes). This patch addresses all the above problems allowing multi-locking and multi-processing for the the overall timer concept in TM. Existing "own_timer_proc" module parameter extended from boolean value to an integer value : 0 - no separate timer proc for TM; 1 - one separate timer proc for TM; n - multiple timer procs for TM.

2014-02-05  Walter Doekes  <walter+github at wjd dot nu>
	* [3b66855] :

	digest+m_auth: Allow a domain in the digest username.
	Before this patch, a domain in the digest username was allowed:

	    Digest username="abc@domain", realm="domain"

	but only if the domain is equal to the realm. This was introduced in
	a92bf789 (Juha Heinanen, Mar. 29 2006).

	The SIP spec. doesn't mention any such restriction.

	This patch undoes that commit and makes sure the whole username is used
	when authenticating through `pv_www_authorize` and `pv_proxy_authorize`.
	That makes the following valid:

	    Digest username="abc@domain", realm="something different"

	* [40962ce] :

	pua: set db_flag to UPDATEDB_FLAG only if there was a previous update (NO_UPDATEDB_FLAG)  - in case of a server restart, if the db_flag went from INSERTDB_FLAG to UPDATEDB_FLAG    the record will be lost because the record is marked as to be updated,    and since there's no record in the db, the update will fail.  - if the db_flag is INSERTDB_FLAG, any updates should leave the flag as is and this    will cause the new record to be properly inserted (and not updated) into the db.

	* [8c21659] :

	enable rabbitmq heartbeat to solve issues of hanging SIP processing because of a broken amqp socket
	This implementation enabled the rabbitmq's client side's heartbeat negotiation.

	Issue:
	Because of TCP's nature, it takes very long time for a TCP peer to make the decision of closing a local socket when the connection actually is broken. The event_rabbitmq module didn't handle the situation which causes the Opensips1.9 stop processing UDP packets until the O.S decides to close the local socket. One of the consequence is that UAC cannot register to the registrar during this time period.

	Issue Reproduce:
	1. Block an existing amqp connection from the rabbitmq-server that event_rabbitmq module connects to.
	2. From the event_rabbitmq side, the UDP receive-buffer that Opensips uses should be full.

	Solution:
	If the module, even_rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client, doesn't get a heartbeat message from the rabbitmq-server within X seconds, the rabbitmq-client will kill the local socket connection actively.

	Added a modparam:

	modparam("event_rabbitmq", "heartbeat", [X seconds]

2013-10-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>

2013-09-25  Earl C. Ruby III  <eruby at knowledgematters dot net>
	* [7ae769d] :

	The latest Linux distros from OpenSUSE, Fedora, and other non-Debian based distros no longer add symlinks for libcurses.so -> libncurses.so. Trying to compile menuconfig with -lcurses will not work on these distros, so I changed -lcurses to -lncurses, since -lncurses will work on any modern Linux distro with the ncurses5 libraries installed.
	See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517756/whats-the-difference-between-lcurses-and-lncurses-when-compiling-c-using-ncur for more info.

	* [7938941] :

	- fixed updating the index of the last DEL operation - this is essential for deciding which lumps must be skipped (as overlapping with delete parts of the message)   Credits go to Nick Altmann for reporting and helping with troubleshooting.   Closes issue #79


2013-09-17  Damien Sandras  <dsandras at beip dot be>
	* [c5a57a8] :

	Fix PUA module so that it sends a final PUBLISH on expiration.
	A final PUBLISH with expires=0 is now generated when a publication has
	expired. This will trigger the transmission of a final state NOTIFY.


2013-09-16  liviuchircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [ba04cba] :

	Fix evi crash when defining more than 10 events


2013-09-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [98330c7] :

	- UAC module does not load (no dependency) on UAC_AUTH if the uac_auth() function is not used. - UAC module does not load RR and DIALOG (with further dependencies on the params of those modules) if no FROM/TO replace ops are done.


2013-09-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [99b233a] :

	- new functions added to help a module to check if its functions are used from the script (we cannot rely on the fixup functions as we have functions without parameters or need for fixup). Such function is needed for fixing dependencies between modules (to follow up)


2013-09-04  liviuchircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [6f048e0] :

	Fix: allow rest_client functions in onreply_route

	- fixed CANCEL matching in B2B


2013-09-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [bb2313d] :

	-  Gracefully detect if the uac_auth modules is available for usage in b2b_entities modules - do not through an error message but rather an info one, as find the uac_auth module is optional.


2013-09-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [ea44068] :

	- when starting the FR timer, it should not override any previous setting of a FR or FR_INV timers.   Solves Issue #25 (reported and troubleshooted by Mayama Takeshi) when a very fast 100 reply may stop retransmissions, but brake the updating of fr timer from FR to FR_INV state.


2013-09-03  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [ec82ef8] :

	* [6dd4b76] :

	* [31a7aa2] :

	Merge pull request #62 from dsandras/ds-dialoginfo-notifications-fixes
	Fixed RFC 4235 notifications compliance.


2013-09-03  Damien Sandras  <dsandras at beip dot be>
	* [515b790] :

	Added new dns_try_naptr option.
	The rationale behind this is that many stacks do not implement NAPTR
	correctly and rely only on DNS SRV. With misconfigured DNS servers, it
	can lead to useless lookups generating potentially long delays.

	This can now be disabled if not needed.


2013-09-03  liviuchircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [b33d4b3] :

2013-09-02  liviuchircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [5a63dcd] :

	Fix replication of dialog delete events
	- instead of sending "deleted" packets based on hash delete operations,
	they are now sent when a dialog changes state to "DLG_STATE_DELETED"
	- this prevents the receiving instance from replicating the event again


2013-08-30  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [5e33750] :

	- fixed NULL sockets in external scenarios (this leads to crashing when building the contact hdr)   Reported by dexteruk on IRC .

2013-08-28  Vlad Paiu  <vladpaiu at opensips dot org>
	* [18257f3] :

	Fixed bug introduced by previous commit : 	- downstream BYEs should go to 200OK leg in order to trigger dialog termination 	- upstream BYEs have no such limitation ( there's only one caller leg :) )


2013-08-28  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [78ff5db] :

	- proper backport of all changes from 1.8 branch


2013-08-27  liviuchircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [389de52] :

	Fix: also run child_init for bin listeners
	- bin listeners are now identified by the PROC_BIN rank
	- this way, only the UDP listeners receive positive ranks


2013-08-26  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [f153a9a] :

	- BYE requests received in confirmed state should terminate the dialog only if they match the TO-tag from 200 OK INVITE.   This affects parallel forking scenarios where rejected branches are terminated via BYE by caller.   Thanks for reporting and testing to Marco Hierl.

2013-08-13  Damien Sandras  <dsandras at beip dot be>
	* [b4d0368] :

	PUBLISH requests are now handled in the same order than received.
	That is specifically useful for pua dialoginfo which was generating dialog
	info notifications that were handled in the wrong order with that patch.
	PUBLISH with older documents were sometimes treated after PUBLISH requests
	with newer documents, leading to incoherent states.
